Dialogue Act Flow labels added to the Stanford Dialogue Corpus

The attached file has Stanford Dialogue Corpus (M. Eric et. al. 2017) with dialogue act flow labels such as 'information request', 'action request', 'assessment request', 'answer', 'thanking' and 'granting' a.o.. When an utterance has multiple dialogue acts, I separated the utterance and labeled each part accordingly. This is still work in progress. So far, 10% of the corpus have been labelled. I will refresh the file every time another 10% of the corpus has been labeled.
